To protect yourself online is the same as protecting your car (thanks Michael Wong!). Don't park your car in a dark alley, don't leave your car doors unlocked, and don't leave anything valuable in plain sight. Ultimately, the best way to protect yourself online is to change your behavior.

Here's a couple of best practices:

1. Never use the same password twice
2. Never use a public wifi network (in a coffeeshop or at the airport) without a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
3. If you see something, say something. You are making the internet safer for everyone when you report bad actors.

4. Never give your personal email to marketing sites or unfamiliar websites
   - Get a junk email for kitty pictures and other things
5. If you don't know the person who sent you an email, never click on any links.
6. If you are unsure about the credibility of something, ask someone!
