The Together Institute was started in September 2019 with the goal of making the internet safer for older adults. Since then, we've learned about a couple trends:

- [There will be 80 million Americans 65 or older by 2035.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/01/can-americas-aging-population-stay-in-their-homes/512009/)
- [1 in 5 older adults has been the victim of fraud](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-advisory-and-report-for-financial-institutions-on-preventing-elder-financial-abuse/)
- [An estimated 37.8 million incidents of fraud took place in 2011, but just over 1 million fraud complaints were received by authorities.](http://longevity.stanford.edu/2013/11/14/the-scope-of-the-problem-an-overview-of-fraud-prevalence-measurement/)
- [Three-quarters of internet users ages 65 and up say they go online daily](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/tech-adoption-climbs-among-older-adults/pi_2017-05-17_older-americans-tech_2-04/)

As more older adults come online, our goal is to decrease the amount of victims of fraud. To solve this, we believe that solutions need to be positive sum, in other words, good for you and good for the public. We also believe that current solutions are designed by younger adults for younger adults. Older adults are completely left out of the design process.

Because of this, we are announcing our first program solving this: "The Together Institute Fellowship."
