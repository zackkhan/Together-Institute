# Top 4 internet scams (cyber threats) targeting older adults

---

Older adults are becoming [increasingly digital and coming online](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/) at a rapid pace. However, the internet was not created with protecting its users in mind. As Vinton Cerf, one of the creators of internet protocols, put it: [“We didn’t focus on how you could wreck this system intentionally.”](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/08/10/the-fate-of-online-trust-in-the-next-decade/#vinton-cerf)

**Here are 4 common types of internet scams you should know about:**

1. Phishing attacks
   - The FTC defines phishing attacks as "when someone sends you an email containing malware." These attacks can be done without any of your personal information.
     - Examples of this include:
       - Emails asking you to download something
       - Emails pretending to be from sites like Google, Dropbox, the government, or banks to get you to share valuable personal information – such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, or your login IDs and passwords
       - Emails disguised as winning entrees for a lottery or prize sweepstake
       - Emails about cheap fake prescription drugs
2. Social engineering attacks
   - Social engineering attacks will use your personal information to disugise their attack.
     - Examples of this include
       - Someone impersonating your friend or family on Facebook to ask for money or personal information
       - Someone gaining your trust through dating apps to ask for money or personal information
3. Fraudulent banner advertisements
   - Unlike physical billboards, digital banner advertisements are much cheaper for scammers to use. Banner advertisements will come in different shapes and sizes, some showing up as a window in your browser to covering your entire browser.
     - Examples of this include advertisements for:
       - Dating in your area
       - Business opportunities/work at home plans
       - Fake investment opportunities
       - Tech support
       - Virus alerts
       - Fake anti-aging products
4. Dangerous websites
   - Dangerous websites will infect your computer just by visiting them.
     - Examples of this include:
       - Any website where you are warned by your browser
       - Any website where you are warned by your antivirus software
     - The best defense against this is to never click on links that you aren't familiar with or trust.

### About us

We believe that access to the Internet is a human right, and that those without the skills to protect themselves online are at risk of social and economic disadvantage. Public services and essential information are increasingly moving online, and many people are unable to access those resources. Many fine organizations are working to spread Internet connectivity to the underserved, but access to technology is only a partial solution. Connectivity needs to be coupled with digital skills training that is relevant and delivered in a way that won’t intimidate the adult learner.

In 2019, The Together Institute was started to build a safer and more accessible internet experience.
